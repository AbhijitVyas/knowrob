knowrob_memory
===

An interface for the acquisition of *experiential knowledge*.
Such knowledge is generally acquired by the *monitored*
execution of some plan.
This package provides predicates that create descriptions
of the plan execution, and that are used to load previous experiences
into the knowledge base.

The main usecase is to create a library of episodic memories
that supports selection of episodes in an expressive language,
and that links descriptions of episodes to low-level data.
Such a collection of episodic memories is a valuable source
of information to e.g. find patterns in activities,
learn motor control behaviours, etc.
